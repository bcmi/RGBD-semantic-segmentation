# RGBD-semantic-segmentation


Our approach is focus on RGBD semantic segmentation task on NYU-v2 and SUNRGBD. The compared methods are listed as follows:

1. RefineNet        &emsp;               **train_base.py**
2. RDFNet            &emsp;           **train_D.py**
3. Deeplabv3+        &emsp;             **train_deeplab.py**
4. PSPNet            &emsp;       **train_pspnet.py**
5. FCN               &emsp;         **train_fcn.py**
