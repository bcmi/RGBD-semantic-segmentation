# RGBD-semantic-segmentation


Our approach is focus on RGBD semantic segmentation task on NYU-v2 and SUNRGBD. The compared methods are listed as follows:

1. RefineNet          &nbsp              **train_base.py**
2. RDFNet              &nbsp          **train_D.py**
3. Deeplabv3+          &nbsp           **train_deeplab.py**
4. PSPNet             &nbsp        **train_pspnet.py**
5. FCN               &nbsp         **train_fcn.py**
